                  The Red Light District (De Wallen) is one of Amsterdam's most famous and misunderstood areas. It’s known for its open approach to sex work, with women displaying themselves in windows, which is legal and regulated in the Netherlands.

                    Amsterdam is globally recognized for its progressive stance on cannabis use. Cannabis is tolerated in "coffeeshops" around the city, where adults can buy and consume marijuana in a safe, regulated environment.

Today, "truffle" mushrooms (a legal form of psilocybin) are available in specialized shops, offering visitors a chance to experience the city's unique approach to alternative lifestyles.
