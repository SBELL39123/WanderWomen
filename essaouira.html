                        While Essaouira is known for its relaxed atmosphere, it's respectful to dress modestly, especially in public areas. Women are advised to cover shoulders, chests, and knees. Opt for lightweight, loose-fitting clothing such as long skirts, maxi dresses, or linen trousers paired with long-sleeved tops. This attire helps you blend in with the local community and shows cultural sensitivity.

                        As in many tourist destinations, be vigilant about potential scams. Common tactics include unsolicited assistance followed by demands for payment, or offers of services that result in unexpected charges. Always agree on prices beforehand and be cautious of "free" services that may come with hidden fees.

                        Always confirm the price of goods and services before accepting them. In markets (souks), haggling is customary, but ensure you agree on a final price before the transaction. For taxis, it's best to agree on the fare before starting your journey or ensure the meter is used. This practice helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures fair transactions.

                        Tipping is customary in Morocco, but it's important to offer tips directly to the person providing the service. Be cautious of individuals who expect tips for unsolicited services or assistance. Being aware of any hidden fees added to bills can also help in managing expenses.

                        While marijuana is illegal in Morocco, it is known that the Rif Mountains in northern Morocco, which include areas not far from Essaouira, are a significant producer of cannabis. However, marijuana use is not openly tolerated in public spaces, and visitors should be cautious. It is important to respect local laws and customs. Possession and use of marijuana can result in serious legal consequences. Always stay informed about local regulations and exercise caution during your visit to Essaouira.
